Welcome back to our series on abusive arguments. In this post, we explore the second defining characteristic: **the refusal to acknowledge or respect differing viewpoints**.

Note: Healthy communication involves listening and understanding, not just defending one’s own stance.

## 2. Always Being Right

{: .box-warning}
Warning: Abusive arguments often involve one person positioning themselves as **infallibly correct**, dismissing any opposing viewpoint as invalid.

In these interactions, disagreements are not opportunities for discussion but are treated as challenges to personal authority. Rather than engaging constructively, the individual outright rejects differing opinions as flawed, irrational, or overly emotional.

For instance, someone operating with this mindset might:
* Insist that their viewpoint is the only logical one, disregarding contrary evidence.
* Claim, "You're just too sensitive," when confronted with a different perspective.
* Frame disagreements as personal attacks rather than genuine differences of opinion.

This unwillingness to engage with alternative views makes meaningful conversation impossible.

This approach erodes trust and mutual respect, making the other person feel unheard and emotionally drained.

### Impact of Refusing to Consider Other Perspectives

When someone refuses to entertain any viewpoint but their own, it creates a toxic environment with serious consequences:
* **Emotional Exhaustion:** Repeatedly being dismissed can wear down a person’s confidence and willingness to communicate.
* **Frustration and Resentment:** Constant invalidation leads to deep frustration and damaged relationships.
* **Breakdown of Dialogue:** Genuine discussion becomes impossible, leading to a cycle of miscommunication and isolation.
* **Loss of Mutual Respect:** The lack of empathy and willingness to listen degrades the foundation of any healthy interaction.

Recognizing this behavior is essential for fostering healthier conversations and relationships.
