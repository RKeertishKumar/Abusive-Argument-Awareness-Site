Welcome back to our series on abusive arguments. In this post, we examine the third defining characteristic: **using manipulative tactics to control the conversation and the other person**.

Note: Abusive arguments are often marked by subtle or overt attempts to control the other person rather than engaging in fair discussion.

## 3. Using Controlling Tactics

{: .box-warning}
Warning: An individual engaged in abusive arguing often **undermines the other person’s confidence and perception of reality** through various manipulative tactics.

Rather than engaging in an open exchange of ideas, an abusive arguer will employ a range of behaviors designed to dominate the conversation and diminish the other person’s self-worth.

Common controlling tactics include:
* **Sarcasm or ridicule** – Mockingly dismissing concerns or belittling the other person’s thoughts.
* **Distorting past events** – Rewriting history to suit their narrative and invalidate the other person’s memory.
* **Interrupting or talking over others** – Ensuring their voice is the only one that matters in the conversation.
* **Intimidating body language or threats** – Using gestures, tone, or physical presence to create fear or unease.
* **Criticism, guilt-tripping, or victim-playing** – Shifting blame, making the other person feel responsible for the conflict, or painting themselves as the victim.

For example, an abusive arguer might intentionally distort facts, mock genuine concerns, or suggest that their partner is irrational or overly emotional in order to dismiss their perspective.

These tactics are not just frustrating—they are designed to **manipulate and control**.

Over time, these behaviors can cause the other person to question their own perceptions, making them more susceptible to further manipulation.

### Impact of Controlling Strategies

Using control tactics in arguments has serious consequences, including:
* **Erosion of Confidence:** Constant ridicule and distortion lead the targeted individual to doubt their thoughts and feelings.
* **Mental and Emotional Strain:** The stress of navigating manipulative behavior can take a toll on mental well-being.
* **Fear of Speaking Up:** Individuals subjected to these tactics may begin avoiding conflict altogether, feeling powerless to assert themselves.
* **Unhealthy Relationship Dynamics:** The imbalance created by control tactics can make relationships feel unsafe and emotionally draining.

Recognizing and calling out these behaviors is a crucial step toward healthier communication.
